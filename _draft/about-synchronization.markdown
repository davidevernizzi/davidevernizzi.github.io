Keeping things synchronized is a difficult task. And it seems to me that
everyone is doing it wrong. Well, maybe not everyone, but IMHO at least Skype
and Twitter are failing at this.

Skype synchronizes way too much. If I spend the whole day on my office computer
and then go home I will probably have already read my messages and I won't need
to see them as unread on my ipad ad home.

On the contrary, if I miss some updates on twitter I may want to start reading
tweets since where I left when I left office.
