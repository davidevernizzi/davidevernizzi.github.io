  bio: I am a full-stack engineer with 15 years of experience in web applications, computer security, and enterprise systems. Earlier, I obtained a PhD. and worked as a postdoc.  I'm happy outside my comfort zone; I can lead teams, talk to customers, and deliver projects. I love debugging and teaching. My native language is Italian, and I am fluent in English and French. I love reading, traveling, and cooking.
