Slightly better day. @EnGi seems pretty well started with his project. @MaCa is very very chatty, but I usually silence him using Slack.

Kids are OK so far. Home schooling is very stressing, but more for me than for them. Cico is doing fine with his teachers, while Anna would like to do it herselft, but her teachers are too dumb :-/.

Robi is quite worried by the COVID-19, but so far she's holding great.
