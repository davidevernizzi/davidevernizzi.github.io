<h2 id="staying-with-kids">Staying with kids</h2>
<p>We have two little children of 7 and 5; when it’s sunny we like to go to the playground in the Valenino park. We often go to have lunch or dinner to the Casa del Quartiere, where the kids can play outside and we can enjoy a glass of wine in the terrace.<br>
In case of bad weather, call us, we can provide books and toys for your kids.</p>
<h2 id="parkings-and-transportation">Parkings and transportation</h2>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.gtt.to.it/cms/risorse/parcheggi/sosta/schede/mappa_zona_blu.pdf">city center</a>, parkingxs can be expensive.<br>
Close to our home parking costs 1.50 euro per hour from 7am to 7pm. After 7pm it might be difficult to find a parking slot and between 8pm and 11 pm it’s almost impossible.<br>
If necessary, an underground parking is available in <a href="https://www.google.it/maps/place/Parcheggio+Madama+Cristina/@45.0585979,7.6809284,17z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sparcheggio+piazza+madama!3m4!1s0x47886d42b5ed1171:0x2930b6a7584614b9!8m2!3d45.0586416!4d7.6838899">piazza Madama Cristina</a>.</p>
<p>In the outskirt of the city free parking is available, especially close to the <a href="https://www.google.it/maps/@45.0332689,7.6670542,15.81z">hospital</a> or close to <a href="https://www.google.it/maps/@45.0625862,7.6501998,15.8z">Politecnico</a> ; if you park there, you can take the subway or the tram number 16 to get back home.</p>
<p>We suggest exploring the city using public transit: tramways, bus, and subway are good enough and it is possible to plan each movement using Google Maps, which is aware of public transit linea and timetables.</p>
<p>If you are staying longer, a good possibility is <a href="http://www.tobike.it">ToBike</a>, the city bike sharing. It is possible to subscribe in piazza Castello or piazza Carlo Felice.</p>

<p>No smoking and no pets. Besides this, just consider this the house of some friends and behave accordingly :-).</p>
<h2 id="garbage">Garbage</h2>
<p>The city of Turin is working hard to increase the quality of its <a href="http://www.amiat.it/cms/servizi/51-raccolta-e-smaltimento-rifiuti/raccolta-differenziata">recycling</a>;<br>
in this context, the door-to-door garbage pickup has started since a few months. The different garbage bins are partly in the street (the non-recyclable part) and partly in the courtyard (paper, glass and metal, food). Please, give your contribution, if possible; we are giving you the keys for the bin in the street (it’s the small one) and the key to the courtyard. We will collect the plastic: please, leave it on the balcony outside the apartment on Thursday night.</p>
<h2 id="checkout">Checkout</h2>
<p>Checkout is at 11am. If you need to checkout later, tell us, we’ll try to accommodate an alternative solution. Usually we manage to allow for later checkout or, in other cases, we keep your luggage in our home.</p>
<p>Before leaving, please <strong>wash the dishes</strong> and put the used towel in the bin in the bathroom. When you leave throw the <strong>garbage</strong> and <strong>empty the fridge</strong>. If we cannot meet at checkout, you can leave the keys on the kitchen table and close the door behind you.</p>
