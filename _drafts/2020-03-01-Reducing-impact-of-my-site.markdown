Global warming is a big problem. I can do many things, but the most relevant impact I can have is to reduce the carbon emissions of my software. I started from this blog.

I did:
- reduced external deps (also good to not track people (more on this on another post))
- removes external dep to fontawesome
- the next largest part if fontawesome, so I have created a tailored font set, based on fontawesome, only containing the fonts I actually use (using https://icomoon.io/app/#/select/font)

Still todo:
- combine into single CSS (currently one for the site and one for the fonts)
- make a PWA
- work on images
