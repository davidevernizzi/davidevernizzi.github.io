Today I was thinking about the concept of acceptable evil. An acceptable evil is something which is far from being ideal, but considering all the alternatives and the context is acceptable. For example for me Apple is an acceptable evil; they do a lot of bad stuff, but given the context, for me, they are an acceptable evil. I'll explain. I don't like the way the are covered with secrecy, nor I don't like that they do so much closed source. And for sure I *hate* the way they close their products, not just code-wise, but also how they prevent interactions between their products and others. However, given I use a computer mainly for development and a phone mainly for everyday life, they achieve an acceptable balance.

My Mac just works. Since years. Day after day, OS update after OS update it just works. No matter where I go, who I need to interact with, I know I can rely on my computer, since it very rarely disappoints me. I open it and it switches on, I close and it switches off, it behave as expected. Many see a Mac like a luxury item, whereas I see it as a workhorse which can carry on the exepcted amount of work reliably for months before I must reboot it.

My iPhone is more or less on the other end of the spectrum. I only use it for very regular and plain usage. Making calls, texting, surfing the web, a few apps. What I expect from my phone is that it is *alway* available. I don't care about fancy features, crazy camera, or unbelievable customization, if it comes at the expenses or reliability.

Of course this is my set of requirements and my set of acceptable evilness. Many out there can't stand a closed source computer and are happy to trade off reliability for openess. I deeply respect that. For them a Dell running Ubuntu is their acceptable evil (I might be biases, my last experience with Linux dates to a few years ago, but at that time the system was far from being as reliable as a Mac. If things have changed, please drop me a line).

And finally, we often must face with unacceptable evil. This happens everytime a client or an employer forces us to use outdated software, chosen without considering us (the users!) and our needs. When this happens productivity is reduced and happyness goes away. And a sad and unproductive employee is someone who will leave the company, sooner or later.
