Apple introduced a new pricing model for iCloud, which is considerably cheaper
than the current one and in line with competitors
(http://mashable.com/2014/06/02/apple-icloud-pricing/). However, Apple is not
like Google, Microsoft or Dropbox.

Apple sells top class laptop and phones
which are designed not to be expandable, so one could end up having a 1.3K$
computer and a 650$ phone without the possibility of expanding their storage
capacity. Given the considerable higher price that competitors products
(compare a Google Nexus) it is just not acceptable that Apple charges me an
additional 0.99$ per month to give me storage space.

I think that Apple should provide an almost unlimited storage on iCloud
(a-la-flickr) for free with any device they sell.
