In [this]() article Bruce Schneier (quite rightly) complains about the security of WhatsApp next features and its impact on society. He claims that "Of course alternatives like Signal will exist for those who don't want to be subject to Facebook's content moderation" and in one of the comments a reader says that "Deleting whatsapp and installing Signal (Or other) takes less than 5 minutes. There just isn't any excuse anymore. Do it. Do it now. Right now"; unfortunately, while technically
this is true, from a user point of view, this is just not possible. We use communication apps and services to, well, communicate and too often we cannot choose the medium we must use, because it is imposed by other (e.g. the other recipients of the communication). In many parts of the world, WhatsApp is the de-facto communication medium, widely used and adopted and it is just not possible to avoid it. The hard truth is that this type of applications must be regulated by wise politics and
not left to the greedy hands of super companies. Unfortunately, these days it is difficult to be optimistic about any wise politics coming to regulate huge monsters like Facebook or Google.
