I was working for a large company and they had slow and complex approval process for everything. Because of that any decision was taking a long time and our project was constantly being delayed. At some point I made a decision for a critical part of the system and I told the team which path we would go; after we implemented the feature, I showcased it to the client and told them that we started doing what we could, but that we could still change idea if they choose differently. As far as I know, the feature is still in production.

I have learnt during the years that often times it is useful to assume that things will go the way you want, act accordingly, and then give people an easy choice to accept the status quo, always knowing that they can change their minds if they want to, but this latter comes with a certain price.
