Programmers hate meetings. I know very few developers who are happy to be interrupted to go to meetings. While this might seem a diva attitute there is truth in this.
There are a lot of posts online that deal with this topic; one of the most importan and significative is this post (http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) by Paul Graham that discusses the difference between what he calls maker schedule from manager schedule. He claims that a single meeting can ruin a whole morning or a whole afternoon. This is completely true.

I was trying to explain this to non programmers and I came up with a analogy.

It's like trying to mentally resolve multiple mazes at the same time and someone interrupts you.

Then I have coded this little game for fun
