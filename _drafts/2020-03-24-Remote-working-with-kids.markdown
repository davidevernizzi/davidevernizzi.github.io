Send kid at kindergarden if possible. Kindergarden is great.

If cannot, like in a epidemic, you must cope with their presence.

My experience so far:

- you will have burst of concentration time (when they have their activities or are engaged by something) and non concentration time (when kids are bored). In my experience the concentration time is often short (half an hour, maybe one hour) and distributed among the day. I call this *focus-time* and *regular-time*.

- explain them why you are closed at home and you cannot leave. Give purpose

- make them grow up. In hard times everyone must take more responsability

- invert the week. Weekdays will be weekends, and weekends are concentrated school days

- relax rules, but be clear that it's not the norm

- put up some routine.

- don't forget the physical training.

- make them more involved with houseworks

- I use scratch extensively: they can play as long as they want if they write their own game

- Prepare things: The idea is to prepare things like preofessional cooks do during the non concentratin time and then assemble them during the concentration time. This way you can maximize the few *focus-hours* per day and somehow make use of the *regular-time*. Do silly things like cloning repos, running long commands, zero inboxing, and so on while the kids are around screaming and begging for attention.

- Do houseworks and chores during voice calls. Pretend you have a low bandwidth so that you can avoid video calls as much as possile, put some bluetooth earphones and while people speak about uncessary things, do necessary things like dish washing or chores.

- Prepare a bunch of work for the kids, so that you can deliver a high amount of things to do when in need of some *focus-time*.
