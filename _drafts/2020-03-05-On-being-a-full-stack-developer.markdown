I like to consider myself as a full-stack developer (even if a few days ago I found out that I might be a [product engineer](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/09/06/how-is-a-product-engineer-different-from-a-full-stack-engineer/)).

I call myself a full-stack developer because during the years I have been exposed to many different technologies:
I started studing computer security (and hence low level cryptographic code),
then I moved to backend and cloud computing,
and recently I started working on frontend too.

I have used a dozen different languager or frameworks, and I like discussing UX and design in general.

Know a lot, but nothing in deep. People often refer to T persons as someone who knows a lot of a topic (the long downward bar) and a little about everything else (the top horizontal bar).
I'd like to consider myself as a T person, but I fail to find my deep topic; on the contrary, I think to myself more as a m person, someone who know quite a bit about many topics,
but nothing deep enough.

There are many reasons why.

I have oftern worked for startups where the execution time was more important than the precision; also, the technology changed quickly enought not to become an expert in anything.

Beside this, I'm someone who get quite curious about things, but loses interest quickly, so I study a lot of different things, but then I lose interest.

How to improve this situation? Following a [great advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE), I have declared this year theme the change. This means that I will try to change things
and among these things I will try to finish a side project, not for the sake of learning a technology, but to do something my own.
