Hi, you probably got here following [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29238120/creating-html-doc-from-postman-collection/29924572#29924572) on Stack Overflow.

Unfortunately, I never had the possiblity to actively support the tool, so it's pretty useless. If you want, it's available on [GitHub](https://github.com/davidevernizzi/docman).
