title:  "git commit does not add :-/"
---

I knew it perfectly, of course, but today, the Commitizen extension in Visual Studio Code was not working (it's a different story).
So I have copied the commit message generated by the extension and tried to use it running `git commit` manually when the linter gave me (silly!) issues.
I have fixed the (silly!) issue and repeated `git commit`, but it stubbornly refused to work. So I started trying to investigate whether the issue was not that
silly (spoiler, it was!), and started descending the rabbit hole of links over links. The odd was that running the linter alone resulted in success.
After a while, I have noticed that I had forgotten the `-a` option when I have started reusing the CLI command. Silly issue and silly me.
